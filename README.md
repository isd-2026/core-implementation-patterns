# About This Repository

This repository contains core implementation patterns and practices used in ISD.

It is used as the main workshop material.

Your tutor will go through the materials in the workshop and allow time for you to practise with your group.

Once the assignment task is released, you may be given time to work on the assignment during workshop sessions.
